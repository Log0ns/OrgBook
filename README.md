# OrgBook
This Internal Compass turns your messy org chart into a high-powered knowledge map! It takes your employee data, sorts everyone into departments and cool 'clumps' (reporting units), and lets you link them directly to the topics and tech teams they master, so you can stop emailing the void and start contacting the right expert every time.
